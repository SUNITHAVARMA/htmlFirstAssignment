            <h3>Murg Makhani (Butter Chicken)</h3>
            <p>Murg Makhani (butter chicken) is one of the top orders at any Indian restaurant in the West and for good reasonâ€”it is delicious. This sultry poultry dish tastes great with kaali daal (black lentils), naan, and a green salad.</p>

            <h3>Tandoori Chicken</h3>
            <p>It's hard to find anyone who doesn't fall in love with tandoori chicken, that famous Indian barbecue chicken recipe. Although traditionally cooked in a clay oven, you can prepare the yogurt-marinated chicken on a grill or in the oven. You do need to plan ahead, as the coated chicken should sit in the refrigerator for 12 to 14 hours.</p>

            <h3>Chicken Tikka Masala</h3>
            <p>Chicken tikka masala is a delicious grilled chicken dish with a thick, creamy gravy that is unforgettable after the first bite. A tomato-yogurt sauce is spiced with chili, garlic, ginger, and garam masala, the ubiquitous Indian spice blend. The chicken is marinated overnight, grilled, and then gently cooked in a slightly smoky gravy. You will want to serve this dish over basmati rice with warm naan bread for soaking up the sauce.</p>

            <h3>Rogan Josh (Red Lamb)</h3>
            <p>The literal translation for Rogan Josh, the name of this dish from Kashmir is "red lamb." The color comes from Kashmiri dry red chilies. While the name may sound fiery, the heat of the dish is toned down by the cream that is added at the end.</p>

            <p>Malai kofta (vegetable "meatballs" in a thick sauce) is the vegetarian alternative to meatballs. The koftas are made with a mix of potatoes, carrots, beans, peas, and sweet corn, which are cooked and mashed before mixing with spices and paneer, that essential blocked "cheese" that is similar to tofu in texture and a great addition to any vegetarian meal.</p>

            <h3>Palak Paneer (Spinach and Cottage Cheese)</h3>
            <p>The most popular paneer recipe at Indian restaurants is, by far, palak paneer. It is a mildly flavored dish that is super healthy, as it is nothing more than spinach and cottage cheese (the paneer), along with the typical Indian spices.</p>
